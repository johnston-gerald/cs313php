<h2>About Gerald</h2>

<p>I’m from Northern Alberta, Canada but I’ve been living in Lake Stevens, Washington
    for the past two years. I met my wife, Michelle, six years ago online. We have
    a sweet little daughter, Haven, who is four years old. This semester, I will
    complete an associate’s in Web Development and then I will be an internship away
    from completing a bachelor’s in Applied Management. I enjoy professional wrestling,
    classic rock, BBQ, computers and electronics, time travel, and fighting crime.
    I served in the Anaheim, California mission. I enjoy eating orange chicken, BBQ-ing,
    and spicy food that makes my mouth burn.</p>
