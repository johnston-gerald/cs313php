<h2>Miracles follow those with sufficient faith</h2>

<p>The Savior promised His disciples that signs would follow those that believe. 
    In fulfillment of this prophecy, the apostles casted out devils, spoke in tongues, 
    and healed the sick. This is in contrast to so many people of the world who 
    say they will believe if they see a sign first. However, we see many examples 
    in the scriptures of hardhearted people who witnessed great miracles and still 
    refused to have faith. Laman and Lemuel, for example, saw an angel and many 
    other miracles but they still wouldn’t believe. Likewise, many of the Jews witnessed 
    Christ perform miracles and even saw Him raise the dead, yet they crucified Him anyway.</p>

<p>Miracles usually do not give someone faith; miracles happen as a result of faith. 
    President Monson explains: “Faith precedes the miracle. It has ever been so and 
    shall ever be. It was not raining when Noah was commanded to build an ark. There 
    was no visible ram in the thicket when Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son 
    Isaac. Two heavenly personages were not yet seen when Joseph knelt and prayed. 
    First came the test of faith–and then the miracle.”</p>
