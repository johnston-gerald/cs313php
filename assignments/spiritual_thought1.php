<h2>Reading, Searching, and Studying</h2>

<p>Jesus said “whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never 
    thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water 
    springing up into everlasting life” (John 4:14). Elder Bednar explains that 
    living water symbolizes Jesus Christ and the gospel. The scriptures serve as 
    a reservoir of living water because they are a record of Christ and His teachings.</p>

<p>Elder Bednar recommends three ways to obtain living water: “reading, studying, 
    and searching.” When we apply these methods, we deepen our understanding of 
    the gospel and draw closer to the Lord. Reading the scriptures gives us an 
    overview and helps us become familiar with basic teachings and concepts. 
    Studying the scriptures focuses on specific topics and provides a more in-depth 
    understanding. Searching the scriptures for “connections, patterns, and themes” 
    adds to what we’ve read and studied and helps us develop gratitude and a strong 
    testimony of the Atonement.</p>

<p>Applying the principles shared by Elder Bednar will help us be more successful 
    in this class. “Reading, studying, and searching” are excellent study habits 
    that can be applied to any subject, religious or secular. As web developers, 
    we learn a new programming language by reading about its rules and syntax to 
    get a general understanding. After reading, we identify and study specific 
    things that we need to work on or things that interest us. Finally, we fix 
    bugs and fine tune our code by searching for “connections, patterns, and 
    themes.” Moreover, feasting on the scriptures will help us get more out of any 
    class because it invites the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost helps us learn, retain, 
    and communicate.</p>
